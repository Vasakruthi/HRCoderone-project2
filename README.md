This script demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis pipeline for classifying movie reviews as either positive or negative. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind text data. The dataset includes sample reviews with their corresponding sentiments, and the text is preprocessed by removing HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords, while also converting to lowercase for uniformity. Using the `CountVectorizer`, the text is transformed into numerical feature vectors that can be fed into a machine learning model. A logistic regression model is then trained to classify the sentiments of the reviews. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, and it can also predict sentiments for new, unseen reviews. This process demonstrates how sentiment analysis can provide insights into customer feedback, helping to identify opinions and trends in text data effectively.
